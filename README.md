## My solutions to Leetcode

I will put my solutions to [Leetcode Problems](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) in this repo. Every problem will be solved in python; part of the problems will be solved in Java also. I will try my best to support more language in the future :)

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions with this repo:)
